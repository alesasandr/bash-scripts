Every morning, Thomas climbed the spiral stairs of the old lighthouse overlooking the sea. For forty years, he had lit its lantern, guiding ships safely through storms and darkness. The townspeople rarely saw him, but they trusted the light like an old friend. One night, a fierce storm hit, and the light went out. Panic spread across the harbor. At dawn, the townsfolk found Thomas asleep beside the lamp, soaked but alive. He had fought the wind all night to relight it. From that day on, the lighthouse was no longer just a beacon—it was Thomas’s legacy of devotion.
